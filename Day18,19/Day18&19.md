## Installation

To install React Router, use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom

Basic Concepts


React Router consists of several core components that manage routing:

-   **BrowserRouter**: A router that uses the HTML5 history API to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
-   **Route**: Renders a UI component when its path matches the current URL.
-   **Link**: Provides a declarative way to navigate to different routes.
-   **Switch**: Renders the first child `<Route>` that matches the location.

Creating Routes


To create routes, wrap your application in a `BrowserRouter` and define routes using the `Route` component.

import React from 'react';

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

import Home from './Home';

import About from './About';

function App() {

  return (

    <Router>

      <Switch>

        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />

        <Route path="/about" component={About} />

      </Switch>

    </Router>

  );

}

export default App;

Linking Between Routes


Use the `Link` component to create navigation links between routes.

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Navigation() {

  return (

    <nav>

      <Link to="/">Home</Link>

      <Link to="/about">About</Link>

    </nav>

  );

}
